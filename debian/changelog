kernel-package (13.014) unstable; urgency=medium

  * There was a bug in the dh install configuration file, that moved all
    kernel-package conf files to /etc/etc/. This commit fixes that.
    (Closes: #751751).
  * jumped on a s390x porterbox, and created initial support for a s390x
    architecture, based mostly on what we did for s390. (Closes: #750604).
  * Bug fix #751751: "conffiles not removed", thanks to Paul Wise. We
    handled obsolete conffiles sub-optimally since they were not really
    supposed to be obsolete.
  * Bug fix #750604: "No Support in kernel-package for s390x

kernel-package (13.013) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-img built with the current kernel-package fails to install on
    an older system (wheezy) due to dependency on kernel-common package
    which is not available there. Based on a suggestion by Michal Hocko,
    changed the relationship to a Recommends, which is what it should have
    been in the first place.  (Closes: #749318).
  * Since the linux-image packages produced by make-kpkg recommend
    kernel-common, , development packages could be forced on to systems
    which installl kernel-common just for the man page. A patch from Sven
    Joachim fixes this oversight. (Closes: #749388).
  * Bug fix #749318: "kernel-img depends on kernel-common", thanks to

kernel-package (13.012) unstable; urgency=low

  * There are three different views of what architecture a machine hasL
    That of the linux kernel, that of dpkg, and that of the GNU
    configuration systems, So, when the user specifies arch and subarch,
    the information has to be transformed for all the systems, as
    required. This commit tries to give the correct information to dpkg,
    and also still take into account sub architecture specifications.
    (Closes: #748702).
  * Add a dependency on dpkg-dev for the kernel-common package, since the
    maintainer scripts use dpkg-architecture. Alsom kernel-package can't
    really do anything useful without pkg-dev, so added there as well.
    (Closes: #748862).
  * Bug fix #748702: "make-kpkg creates packages with missing architecture

kernel-package (13.011) unstable; urgency=low

  * The fix for building packages with the correct sub--architecture was
    flawed, in the sense it always looked at theKPKG_ARCH, even when there
    was no need to stray away from DEB_HOST_ARCH. This commit relieas on
    dpkg-architecture to tell us what the proper arch should be for a
    situation where we are building for a subarchitecture.
    (Closes: #748316).

kernel-package (13.010) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer have generated kernel images depend on ksymoops, a long
    defunct package, since it is useless with kernels >= 2.6.
    (Closes: #748066).
  * When the user asks for the arch name to be part of the kernel image
    package version string, only image and debig packages included the
    arch in the name. This commit makes the name of the header package
    also be consistent with the image names. At this point, the source and
    document/manual package names remain generic, since arch specific
    differences should not exist in those packages. (Closes: #568576).
  * the image packages generated by kernel-package also build in the
    modules requested in the configuration file, so there is no
    linux-moules-* package. However, in case there are dependencies on
    that package name, the image package now also claims to provide the
    modules package. (Closes: #599815).
  * In order to ease the life of people cross compiling, or building for a
    subarch, do not call dpkg-gencontrol with the host archtecture, but
    rather, with the architecture we built the kernel image for.
    (Closes: #563300).
  * Hopped on to an armel machine to test make-kpkg. The CPU is reported
    as arm by dpkg-architecture, so the top level logic in kernel-package
    was correct.Unfortunately, the armel specific file wassumed the CPU
    was armel, so nothing got included.  Corrected that inner check in
    this release.  (Closes: #664854).

kernel-package (13.009) unstable; urgency=low

  * pared down on the list of suggested packages, and added to the build
    dependencies packages that are actually useful when building kernels
    (as opposed to packages that might be required for kernel images).
    (Closes: #747925).
  * only make the kernel depend on initramfs tools if a initrd was
    requested.  This reduces the number of dependencies to those really
    required.  (Closes: #747911).
  * Created a new kernel-common package to host kernel-img.conf
    manpages. Create a default kernel-img.conf similar to the one
    generated by the base installer, and register with ucf. Updated the
    man pages and the examples. Made the generated kernel image packages
    recommend the kernel-common package.  (Closes: #626216).

kernel-package (13.008) unstable; urgency=low

  * The underlying kernel tree has long removed support for zImage
    images. This makes bzImage the default, so there is no need to have
    the user specify one or the other, so removed the --zImage and the
    --bzImage options from kernel-package. Removing this also removed code
    that caused confusion in the image names when --bzImage argment was
    used.  (Closes: #574957).
  * Modified the manual pages to reflect the changes aboue. Updated the
    po4a .po files and .pot files.  Also clarified the requirements for
    running as root,, and emphasized that fakeroot is th way to go, and
    running as root is not recommended. Clarified that make-kpkg is
    supposed to be run after configuring the kernel. (Closes: #704116).
  * Previously, the Debian revision had to contain a digit. Now dpkg
    complains if it does not start with a digit. Updated the  sanity
    checks to test for this new constraint.   (Closes: #674101).
  * Removed a versioned dependency on make, for a version older than the
    one present in oldstable.

    shall cause the build to fail, and provides an alternative. However,
    there are lots of people who set DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=N, which
    causes dpkg-buildpackage to do effectively that.  This commit strips

kernel-package (13.005) unstable; urgency=low

  * Normally, if the kernel configuration file enables support for
    modules, the kernel image package produced by kernel-package contains
    the modules, and the modules have a link to the location of the
    debugging symbols file for the mdoule, usually installed by the debug
    package. However, adding this link changes the signature of the module,
    which is not a good thing is module signing is also enabled. This
    version does not install the link to debug symbols if module signing
    is enabled in kernel configuration. Please recompile without moduile
    signatures in order to debug modules. (Closes: #722946).

kernel-package (13.004) unstable; urgency=low

  * There were some places where we still recommended custom.1.0 instead
    of 1.0.custom, even though the former is now not acceptable. This
    commit fixes the remaining locations where that advice was incorrect.
  * When compiling in a git checkout of the kernel sources: the
    KERNELRELEASE variable contains the key word dirty, even though the
    tree is clean, and verified by git status. This is caused by using
    fakeroot make-kpkg .../ Updated documentation to not the preferred
    form is to use make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot to avoid this.
    (Closes: #717807).
  * If you build from the git tree of the linux kernel, and you are not on
    a tagged branch, the script scripts/setlocalversion will append a plus
    sign to the version if the repository is not in a clean annotated or
    signed tagged state and LOCALVERSION= is not specified. This creates
    problems when packaging the resulting image. Updated the documentation
    for workarounds. (Closes: #721482).
  * Patch to build uImage kernels for ARM by  Andrew Bradford. This adds
    the --uimage option to build a uImage kernel for ARM systems. Needs
    uboot-mkimage installed to do so, This package contains the mkimage
    utility, which encapsulates a compressed  "uImage" Linux kerel image
    with header information, CRC32 checksum, etc,  for use with the U-Boot
    bootloader.  (Closes: #572117).
  * Since the debug images all upload files in the same location, they
    conflict with each other.  (Closes: #570635).
  * Starting with 2.6.35 there is a new kernel config target (nconfig)
    which is something like menuconfig just a bit fancier. Added support
    for that. (Closes: #590446).
  * The generated image packages now suggest the corresponding manual
    packages, in addition to the doc packages. Made the doc and manual
    packages suggest each other.  (Closes: #593895).

kernel-package (13.003) unstable; urgency=low

  * The image installation process upstream has changed; and uses the
    /sbin/installkernel method now (which is not really aware of
    installing into a temp directory for packaging). Updating the install
    process to match. This also means that this version of kernel-package
    can not compile kernels older than July 2009.
  * Fixed a typo in the control file for debug image packages.
  * Just compiled a kernel linux-image-3.15.0-rc4 with these changes
    (Closes: #745686).
  * To build a kernel  with LZ4 compression enabled, lz4c is
    needed. Added a suggests for liblz4-tool (Closes:  #746539).
  * As part of an effort to deter kernel exploits, System.map and the
    kernel image should be made readable by root only to prevent attackers
    from getting knowledge of kernel addresses. This version of kernel
    package does exactly that.  (Closes: #615029).
  * Upstream kernel Makefiles provide an header_install target to install
    sanitized headers into the destination. Use that while generating the
    headers package.  (Closes: #696922).
  * Bash autocomletion doesn't support all target commands.  Bartosz Janda
    provided an updated autocomplete script (Closes: #696264).
  * Previously the lguest source moved from Documentation/lguest to
    Documentation/virtual/lguest, and more recently it moved again to
    tools/lguest. Look now in all these places. (Closes: #690813).
  * The documentation for the kernel requires db2html from the

    the package, but there was some surprise when the documentation
    packages ended up mostly empty. Moved the relationship to Recommends.

    build system.
  * Move way from git modules to a flatter structure, to better use
    standard git build frameworks. (Closes: #690002).
  * Updated the dependency to from module-init-tools -> kmod, since the
    module-init-tools is an obsolete transitional package.
    (Closes: #733701, #663358, )
  * As of 3.8-rc2, kernel building requires bc(1. Added bc as a dependency
    for kernel-package, so that building a kernel will work again
    (Closes: #705587, #702600,  #742674).
  * There are new configuration options called CONFIG_MODULE_*, which
    confuse the regular expression trying to detect whether modules are
    configured or not. Modified the regular expression to detect
    whether modules are configured as suggested by Stefan Gehn.
    (Closes: #696537).
  * make-kpkg failed to cross build armhf kernels. The supplied patch by

    the case of cross-building (Closes: #728014).
  * The UTS_RELEASE definition was moved from

    $(KERN_ROOT)/include/generated/utsrelease.h. The current version looks
    in both places. Fix sggested by  mahashakti89, (Closes: #591793).
  * find -perm syntax changed from -perl +XXX to -prem /xxx. Fixed

  * [0f83b83]: [master]: allow arch specific Makefiles to override
    objcopy as needed. kernel-package fails to build a kernel package on
    hppa when the target kernel is 64-bit. It fails because kernel-
    package uses hardcoded "objcopy" to build /usr/lib/debug debuginfo
    files for kernel modules but 64-bit kernel needs crosscompile prefix
    on parisc and normal objcopy does not understand the 64-bit module
    format. This change uses the same mechanism as the kernel Makefiles
    to allow arch specific Makefiles to specify what to use as objcopy.
    Bug fix: "wrong objcopy on 64-bit parisc, debug symbol stripping
    fails", thanks to Meelis Roos                        (Closes: #576725).
  * [f0bf2cf]: [master]: use KERNELRELEASE instead of version in the few

    patch converts the remaining places that do not use KERNELRELEASE.

kernel-package (12.028) unstable; urgency=low

  * More bug fixes with the XEN images.
  * [3ec0509]: Brown Paper bag spelling fix: iamge -> image
  * [34fa772]: Rework handling of XEN packages

    So far, kernel-package would pay special attention to the
    configuration files that enabled XEN hypervisor/guest images, mangling
    the package name, and changing the file paths where the images were
    dumped. This caused no end of confusion to third party tools, and also
    surprised people when packages with different names had unexpected
    file conflicts. With dpkg defaulting to --force-overwrite that could
    be catastrophic.  This is because a normal kernel image, a XenU or a
    Xen0 image, all looked for modules in /lib/modules/$version, and would
    conflict.

    With this commit, kernel-package stops paying attention to the XEN
    configuration hints in the config, producing a normal kernel image.
    If users want to have a DomU or a Dom0 image from the same kernel
    version, they will have to do what people wanting to run kernels witht
    he same version with differing configurations have always had to do:
    use --append-to-version to make the kernel images packages not
    conflict.

  * [debiandir:9dced49]: Change the section to "kernel" That makes it come in
    conformity with the new sectioning schema.
  * [fdc8183]: only trigger initramfs removal on 'remove', and not again
    on purge. (This is a change in an example script). Also, since this is
    a remove, and the initramfs call is a convenience function for clear
    out initramfs-tool metadata, we do not care if it actually worked. We
    just make the best effort at clean up, but do not let the cleanup
    abort the process.

  * [55b39b3]: Move invocation of postinst hook scripts after
    /etc/kernel/*.d/* scripts A lot of people have update-grub in their
    /etc/kernel-img.conf postint_hook setting. If that is called early,
    the initramfs invocation in /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs has not
    yet happened, so the update grub script does not notice the
    initramfs, making the system unbootable. Yes, the update grub cant
    be moved into /etc/kernel/postinst.d/ too, but this is friendlier.

  * [0ee9cc3]: Keep modifications to the upstream directory to a minimum
    When upstream kernel build system started delting ./debian directory
    on clean, we had to start taking making an effort to preserve
    ./debian, since there was a lot of information in there that was
    important to us. So we had a way of diverting the makefile and
    scripts away that did the removal of ./debian, and restoring them
    when we wanted to. Now that the ./debian directory has become
    ephemeral, we only need to preserve it when calling clean during the
    buildpackage target, since invoking make-kpkg at any other time
    cleans ou ./debian anyway. So we can be more selecting in when we
    divert upstream scripts; and thus leave the upstream directory more
    like we found it (this makes git happy).
  * [2c00231]: Copy all the examples into the kernel image package
    Arguably, the examples are more relevant in image directories than
    they are in the kernel-package doc directory. There was a error in
    the kernel image target, caught by Sedat Dilek.

  * [75423e7]: Export maintainer script parameters to hook scripts
    Maintainer script option need to be passed on to the hook scripts,
    since there are many ways that the script may berun (for example,
    postinst hooks scriopts are called even when the installation is
    aborted). This commit adds the maintainer script arguments to an

  * This is a major change from the version shipped in Lenny.
  * [123d487]: Get rid of the facility to patch kernel sources

    The patch the kernel facility was adding complexity, and failing to
    provide the flexibility required for a generic patching facility. It
    has been removed, users need to patch the sources _before_ calling
    make-kpkg.
  * [ce61f77]: Remove special case code for official kernels
    Allows for minimal recompiles after minor changes t the kernel; and we
    can now recreate ./debian cheaply, so version mismatches are
    mitigated.
  * [7cc98b0]: Modified the maintainer scripts for the header package
  * [ff0f1eb]: Modified the maintainer scripts for the doc package
  * [f32d2ba]: Modified the maintainer scripts for the source package

    These patches extends the package maintainer scripts to all four
    actions, and creates the directories that the hook scripts can be
    dropped in for site configuration of the actions that the package
    takes.

    The link manipulation that the header packages used to do in the
    postinst has been removed, and is now provided as an example
    script.
  * [cdcd478]: Image postinst no longer runs a boot loader
    Note that this was already the case for grub, one of the more popular
    boot loaders.  This allows the image package to be more flexible, since the
    end user is no longer restricted to the actions encoded in the image
    package. This is a fairly large change.
    Bug fix: "mentions of grub on ia64", thanks to dann frazier. This was
    a pretty minor bug, but is obsoletre since we no longer run boot
    loaders, and thus have no need t warn people os a possible mismatch
    with local policy.                                    (Closes: #515138).
  * [f8bc553]: The postinst no longer manipulates symlinks

    Any symbolic link  manipulation must now be done with hook scripts in
    /etc/kernel/*.d directories (modern bootloaders don't need the links
    anyway). Eample hook script demonstrate how a more flexible local
    policy for symlinks can be easily put ihnto place, replacing the
    fairly rigid policy previously implemented.
  * [84364f0]: The image postinst no longer runs the initrd command
    The postinst now just conveys to the hook scripts whether
    this particular image was configured for an initial ram image or
    not, using the environment variable INITRD. There are example
    scripts provided that will perform the task. These scripts will work
    for official kernel images as well.
    Bug fix: "postrm script leaves stale files in
    /var/lib/initramfs-tools/", thanks to Jan Muszynski. The proposed fix
    was not good, since it would require kernel-package to muck around
    with internal files for initramfs tools. This way, the user may add an
    postrm.d script that uses the accepted interface to clean up.

  * [ecb2bd3]: make-kpkg removes and re-creates ./debian on every invocation
    Bug fix: "Normal make functionality seems broken", thanks to David
    Baron. Actually, normal make functionality is not to recreate targets
    until there is need, and thus the stamp files are all that needed to
    be removed. However, until now, we could not regenerate

  * [b2413fc]: Provide version when using the minimal rules file.
    When the ./debian directory does not exist, the frirs

kernel-package (11.003) unstable; urgency=high

  * [e12e615] Fix the build system to accommodate XEN changes, use kbuild as far as possible

    These are fairly extensive changes. Firstly, we try to use upstream
    kbuild as far as possible, to reduce churn as the files upstream
    installs change. Some added checks of the Makefile are now in place so
    we retain backwards compatibility. This should improve things lot wrt
    header files.  We also now add dependencies to more packages actually
    required to build kernel images.

    We also try to look for the kbuild created KERNELRELEASE variable,
    which is designed to be used by distros to figure out where modules
    are to be loaded from, etc. This should help reduce version
    mismatches. We also prepare the kernel.release file early, to help
    that.

    We also refitted to support the new XEN code in mainstream, in that
    the same image can be booted normally or be used as a XEN image. This
    support probably needs to be improved.

    The make target dependencies have been extensively reworked, to
    minimize surprises and wasted effort. We also strip modules, based on
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS (nostrip).

    Extra care is now taken so we do not accidentally remove ./debian
    while cleaning, thanks to upstream helpfully removing ./debian when
    cleaning.  This should prevent dpkg-buildpackage from accidentally
    shooting itself in the foot by removing ./debian as its first action.

    Bug fix: "No such file or directory", thanks to Marc Haber. I am fairly
    sure this is fixed. The code around the cleaning has been
    thoroughly revamped, and there have been a large number of test runs.
                                                          (Closes: #410035).

    a working Xen setup.                                   (Closes: #446879).

    Bug fix: "Version check compares wrong vars", thanks to Matthijs
    Kooijman. Actually, this is ont the case. We do check the upstream
    version against our best guess of what whould be the correct string --
    and then we ensure what we think is the right thing is what the URS
    header thinks is the corect one. In any case, the KERNELRELEASE
    changes above make this moot.                          (Closes: #433217).

    Bug fix: "local version not set when config is out of date", thanks to

  * [22c79c6] Move to a streamlined, make -j friendly build system
    While I am not sure of this fixes some of the nagging problems we have
    been facing in recent versions of kernel-package, where we used double
    colon rules, which were convenient, sure, but played havoc with
    ordering of the rules, and had to have various band-aids to help out
    with the ordering. The system was rapidly growing complex, with clear
    indication that it was actually faster.

    The new target mechanism does away with doublecolon rules, and should
    play better with parrallel compilation.

  * Bug fix: "/sbin/update-grub is run by default by kernel postrm if it

    ignore missing hooks. This means: Don't gracefully handle missing hook
    scripts, the diagnostic might be lost in a flurry of messages,  and
    the user may never be aware that the hook script was never run.
    Depending on what the hook script is meant to do, this may cause a

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: version suffix added when building in git
    trees ", thanks to Marcus Better. When run in a git sourced tree,
    scripts/setlocalversion checks to see if the tree is the trunk, if
    not, it adds version information to the kernel version. It also checks
    to see if there are uncommited changes, if so, it adds the string
    "-dirty" to the version. Since we change a couple of files in
    ./scripts/, this falls afoul of the make-kpkg checks, since the
    version number is now different from what make-kpkg knows it to
    be. Also, there is an additional truncated commit ID added by the
    script scripts/setlocalversion whenever it detects that we are not
    building from a tagged commit of the official tree, so it might be
    just simpler to get rid of scripts/setlocalversion altogether, so we
    now move it out of the way in the config phase, and restore during
    clean. This allows make-kpkg to be useful for building from got trees
    again.                                                (Closes: #406180).
  * Bug fix: "powerpc arch problems with 2.4 kernel", thanks to Brendan

    the version numbers -- which we can't get to unless we know the kernel
    architecture. Yossarian would have liked this. Use grep to get the
    most significant digits of the version number. Use these to calculate
    significant digits of the version number. Use these to calculate the
    KERNEL_ARCH. Use KERNEL_ARCH to get to the full version. This change
    allows us not to drop support for 2.4 kernels on powerpc machines. It
    does not impact anything but powerpc, and should not cause a change of
    behavior on 2.6.16+ kernels even on powerpc.            (Closes: #411038).

    {kernel,linux}-source-* package _installed_ on the system, but not the
    version of the package that the current source tree was _untarred_
    from. (Eg. one untars the source tree from linux-source-2.6.18-6, then
    (s)he updates the installed package to linux-source-2.6.18-7, then
    builds a kernel in the previously untarred source tree. In this case
    the source really used is 2.6.18-6, but it writes 2.6.18-7 to

    the image and modules packages will be separated, to allow for

  * Bug fix: "make-kpkg clean: leaves scripts/package/Makefile.kpkg-dist

    prevented the naming back scripts/package/Makefile.kpkg-dist to
    scripts/package/Makefile -- making clean not restore the package to
    original state after running build/clean.  There is little downside to
    this typo fix; we rename the Makefile, and we should be restoring it
    in clean.                                               (Closes: #397518).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: linux-headers doesn't inclue arch-specific

    modules on on IA64/McKinley ItaniumII,  the Makefile in arch/ia64/
    needs some scripts from arch/ia64/scripts/ directory. These scripts
    were not so far being shipped. On non ia64, this has no impact on the
    headers package built; on ia64 the changes are required for the
    headers package to have any value.                (Closes: #405494).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: kernel image cant be installed when vmlinuz
    link is already", thanks to Kai Sassmannshausen. Actually, the problem
    was not depending on a new enough version of coreutils. See Below.

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: dependency problem: kernel package
    installation uses a invalid option of readlink", thanks to Kai
    Sassmannshausen. In release version 10.063, I cleaned up the  postinst
    as while I was at it, going with readlink -q -m instead of the built
    in version. Since -m was a flag not present in Sarge's coreutils, this
    means the generated image files should have a versioned dependency on
    coreutils. The previous versioned dependency was not strict enough,
    updated to a version that works.                      (Closes: #407130).

  * With this release of kernel package, changes have been made to the
    specification and behaviour of hook scripts for the kernel image,
    source, and header packages. Now relative paths can be used to specify
    the names of scripts, as long as these scripts live in a "safe" path,
    namely, /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin. Also, the sanity checking
    has gotten more rigorous, failure to find a hook script or failure for
    the script to execute correctly is now a fatal error.
  * Bug fix: "forces absolute paths in /etc/kernel-img.conf *_hook
    variables", thanks to Robert Millan. I elected not to use the patch
    provided, since I did not want to blindly trust the PATH variable, and

  * Bug fix: "linux-image-2.6.16-2-k7-smp: upgrade re-ran lilo", thanks to
    Ross BoylanThe default behaviour of the postinst script has been to
    run the built in default bootloader (typically lilo) -- set at compile
    time, based on the arch. The installed default for Debian, however,
    has since moved on to be grub. However, users who are transitioning to
    grub may not have set the configuration variable in
    /etc/kernel-img.conf --and may still have lilo installed. The trick is
    to figure out whether they really want to run lilo. So, if there is no
    /etc/lilo.conf, we run nothing. If the user has explicitly asked to
    run lilo, we rin lilo. Or if there is no grub, or if there is no
    postinst hook script, we run lilo. Or else, we ask the user.

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: make-kpkg "dirties" git kernel", thanks to
    Rob Sims.  Make sure that make-kpkg clean undoes the changes made in
    ./scripts. Also, added to the PROBLEMS file the following issue: When
    run in a git sourced tree, scripts/setlocalversion checks to see if
    the tree is the trunk, if not, it adds version information to the
    kernel version. It also checks to see if there are uncommited changes,
    if so, it adds the string "-dirty" to the version. Since we change a
    couple of files in ./scripts/, this falls afoul of the make-kpkg
    checks, since the version number is now different from what make-kpkg
    knows it to be. The workaround is to modify the setlocalversion
    script.                                                (Closes: #375559).

  * Bug fix: "Support for Xen as a subarch", thanks to Tore Anderson. No
    special handling need be required -- with a properly created .config
    file, make-kpkg should automatically detect Xen 3.0.1 or 3.0.2, and
    appropriately set the arch and subarch variable.        (Closes: #346387).

    Xen, versus the normal i386  build. We change boot loader definitions,
    dependencies, targets, and image destinations.
  * kernel/ruleset/architecture.mk: No longer assume that the presence of
    CONFIG_XEN implies the ARCH is also xen; since now the ARCH is i386,
    but the subarch is xen.
  * kernel/ruleset/common/archvars.mk: Now we include .config earlier, to
    allow us to detect xen and uml, and automatically set the arch and
    subarch variables based on the configuration file. This help people

    it is up to the users to handle incompatibilites between previously
    installed third party modules and the new kernel. No check on

  * Optimize building kernel headers on recent kernels.
  * kernel/ruleset/local.mk (kernel-headers kernel_headers) Make
    kernel-headers depend on debian/stamp-prepare, instead of
    stamp-build-arch, since this means for 2.6.X kernels the full build may
    not be needed, with the advent of the prepare target.
  * kernel/ruleset/targets/target.mk (debian/stamp-prepare): Added this
    target: on new kernels, it merely calls prepare. I wish I could come up
    with a non-kludgey way of testing for the presence; I guess calling
    make -np |grep would work, but it is simple enough to just test the
    version numbers. When it breaks, we'll see. On older kernels it still
    calls the stamp-build-arch target.
  * Unfortunately, this still does not fix #345939, since we have
    $(patsubst %,BUILD/%,$(DEB_ARCH_PACKAGES))  :: BUILD/% : testdir  BUILD-arch
    Which means that we build the kernels for all arch related packages --
    it is hard to follow all the dictums of policy and cherry pick some of
    arch related packages _without_ doing the build.
  * Now, we moved building the kernel out of the build-arch target, and
    into the kernel image target instead. Does not help a lot overall, but
    may prevent duplicate invocations of build.
  * All in all, made a bunch of changes to optimize for speedier rebuilds.

kernel-package (10.030) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the kernel image psotinst more resilient towards errors in
    initramfs generators. The old behavior was that the postinst took the
    list of generators (either determined based on the kernel version
    being installed, or the user's preferences), asked each one of the
    listof candidate generators wehther they supported the running and to
    be installed versions of the kernel, and then tried the first of the
    list of those that answered yes. The new behaviour is not to just stop
    at th first viable candidate, but to continue down the list until we
    get a generator that succeeds.
  * reverse the order of  mkinitramfs and mkinitrd.yaird in the dependency
    list of the kernel image packages, since then initramfs-tools shall
    come earlier in the dependency listing, and apparently initramfs-tools
    currently has fewer problems upgrading from older kernel versions that
    do not support /sys (like, say, Sarge kernels). The users can still
    provide their preferences in kernel-pkg.conf while building, or
    kernel-img.conf while installing; all we are doing is changing the
    default order of dependencies.
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: make-kpkg ignores the --revision argument",

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: latest unstable version breaks linux-2.6
    build on amd64", thanks to Frederik Schueler. Now we let the
    architecture still be whatever DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU says it should
    be. Just set KERNEL_ARCH correctly on amd64/x86_64 machines early, so
    that make-kpkg clean does not flake out when there is no ./debian dir.
    Accept either x86_64 or amd64 as the architecture, just in case, when
    selecting the correct Makefile snippet. So it is perfectly fine to
    still say --arch=amd64, like  linux-2.6 does             (Closes: #344740).
  * Bug fix: "[powerpc] k-p 10.00x breaks debconf based /etc/kernel/*.d
    scripts like mkvmlinuz", thanks to Sven Luther. Well. In the recent
    10.X series, kernel package has started producing image packages whose
    maintainer scripts use debconf for user interaction. Unfortunately,
    this meant that any hook scripts called in the maintainer scripts for
    the image package (update-grub comes to mind), if they wrote anything
    at all to the STDOUT, would cause debconf to throw hissy fits, since
    it was expecting commands on STDOUT, not random chatter from the hook
    scripts.

    One solution was to call db_stop before calling the hook scripts, and
    redirecting stdout to stderr in hte invocation of the
    scripts. Unfortunately, this made any scripts that used debconf
    impossible.

    So, either we ban scripts that are interactive, or scripts that
    scribble on stdout.  Since the former makes some functionality
    impossible (some scripts can deliver added functionality and
    flexibility if they can interact with users), and the latter just
    needs a code change, I would prefer to ask packages that provide
    scripts to be used in kernel image postinst/postrm to use debconf for
    user interaction, and to send diagnostics to STDERR.

kernel-package (10.012) unstable; urgency=low

  * It was pointed out to me that the ability to build third party modules
    using make-kpkg and linux kernel headers packages had broken with
    recent kernel packages, since the check for whether we were in a top
    level kernel source directory failed to take into account if we were
    in a header package directory, which is sufficient.
  * Additionally, older kernel-package versions appear to want to run
    oldconfig in the headers package tree, which failed, since there was
    inadequate support for running oldconfig. This has also been fixed,
    since all we really need to depend on is a .config file.
  * Finally, make-kpkg insists on there being a ./debian directory, and it
    makes sense to ship the directory in the source and header packages,
    since shipping it means that we also remove the need for
    kernel-package to be installed on the target system

kernel-package (10.008) experimental; urgency=low

  * Well, it turns out that only on some architectures do we havea binary
    using a dynamically loaded shared library, so the call to dpkg-shlibs
    was failing on the others. Now, go throug a complex dance in which we
    either call dpkg-shlibs, or edit the control file using Perl, so that
    both cases can be catered to.

kernel-package (10.007) experimental; urgency=low

  * Aaargh, typo in the kernel header rules.
  * The generated packages should not have native version numbers by
    default, since they are not really debain native packages. The problem
    was that the default version generated did not have a -, so chnaged
    that value. The files affected are kernel-pkg.conf, README,
    kernel/ruleset/misc/version_vars.mk , kernel-pkg.conf.5,
    kernel/docs/README,  kernel/ruleset/misc/config.mk.
  * While looking at Lintian errors, I noticed that apparently
    kernel-headers package carries with it an elf binary, and thus should
    depend on the shared libraries -- but did not. Fixed now by a search
    and a call to dpkg-shlibs. Various minor nitpicks in the default
    Control file also fixed.
  * We also added a make snippet to find and strip the binaries we need to
    run  dpkg-shlibs upon, since that is the policy.
  * kernel/ruleset/targets/image.mk: Export the variable IMAGE_TOP before
    calling scripts in $(SRCTOP)/debian/image.d and debian/post-install,
    since that is what they expected. Bad idea changing an exposed
    interface.
  * kernel/pkg/image/postrm:  Call purge to remove the questions from
    debconf database when the package is purged.

  * Hmm. We need to take special care of the case in which the
    kernel-headers are installed after the kernel-image has been; and the
    build symlink is not setr. In this case, the header postinst now
    correctly installs the build symlink.

kernel-package (10.005) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "kernel/image.postinst should mention GRUB", thanks to
    Martin Michlmayr. Well, I don't see why we should mention _any_ boot
    loader at all, so we are no longer biased against grub. (Closes: #336927)
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Using dpkg --remove followed by dpkg
    --install does not restore the kernel package", thanks to Daniel
    Jacobowitz. Also: "kernel-package tells me we're being reinstalled AND
    updated". Actually, the installed/updated is just sematics; when you
    reinstall a kernel image you are updating it, and vice versa. The
    actual problem was that while the symbolic links were removed when the
    package was removed, dpkg passed the last-version-configured to the
    postinst, and we took that as evidence that the package had been
    installed before -- which, while true, did not take into account that
    the package was currently uninstalled. The fix is to always see if a
    missing symlink needs to be installed, and not touch existing
    symlinks.                                       (Closes: #336733,  #336517).
  * Added kernel/pkg/headers/create_link as an example. The user can install
    it in the postinst.d directory to set up the /lib/modules/foo/build
    symlink to point to the kernel-headers. This is not needed, since the
    kernel-image postinst already checks in the /usr/src/ directory for an
    installed kernel headers package.
  * Convert the image prerm scripts to debconf as well, the questions are
    asked if we try to remove the running kernel image, or if we are
    removing a kernel version mentioned in boot loader configuration.
  * Have the minimal.mk not overwrite the control or the changelog file.
  * Added a whole slew of config files, and updated older ones, to bring
    the configurations offered up by default to be more in line with
    official kernels.
  * Fixed substitutions in the kernel image package, there was a duplicate
    =B substitution.
  * Ran lintian on all the generated packages. Fixed FSF address in all
    the copyright notices, and fixed case in the templates file as
    well. This shall be the last experimental release, barring major
    problems.

kernel-package (10.004) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "using debconf", thanks to Robert Millan      (Closes: #115884)
  * Bug fix: "does not install non-interactively", thanks to Matt Kraai
                                                           (Closes: #247782)
  * This fine tunes the dependencies between targets. All of the package
    building targets are ones that insert themselves into the normal flow
    of policy specified targets, so they must hook themselves into the
    stream. That means, in essence, that they must depend on the configure
    and  corresponding build targets (with stamps) and ensure that the
    prep work is all done before they are invoked. The advantage is that
    nothing is going to be remade more often than it needs to. It also
    means we do not need to produce as many stamp files. So, the only
    dependencies on any of the intermediate targets are targets that have
    not been registered into the ladder created in rulesets/common/targets.mk
  * The kernel image maintainer scripts have been greatly
    changed. Firstly, they now use  debconf; and a number of questions
    have been moved to the config file (create-kimage-link-$version,
    old-initrd-link, old-dir-initrd-link, old-system-map-link) while
    others are asked conditionally in the postinst (depmod-error,
    depmod-error-initrd, bootloader-test-error, bootloader-error). The
    postinst has also become far less verbose; the users are far better
    educated a decade after this was written, and there are other sources
    of information about booting than the postinst of a kernel image.
  * The preinst also uses debconf. All the questions asked are still here
    -- we just use debconf to ask the user. Also, the priority, and need
    to break non-interactive installs was re-evaluated, and the preinst
    breaks in far fewer cases than it did before.
  * Second, the postinst gets rid of the code that generated boot floppies
    and created lilo.conf (that latter was probably illegal under current
    policy anyway). The do_boot_enable and do_boot_floppy configuration
    variables in /etc/kernel-img.conf are now invalid.
  * Also, the source tree is not automatically cleaned; the do_clean
    configuration variable, and the environment variable CLEAN_SOURCE are
    now control if the source tree is optionally cleaned after the kernel
    image package is built.

kernel-package (10.003) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "can not clean up the kernel source tree", thanks to
    Chun-Chung Chen.                                         (Closes: #336409)
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package creates packages depending on
    linux-initramfs-tools, should use linux-initramfs-tool", thanks to
    Thomas  Luzat.                                           (Closes: #336724)
  * Bug fix: "/usr/share/doc/kernel-package seems to contain broken
    symlinks", thanks to Thomas Luzat                        (Closes: #336744)
  * This is a major reorganization of the rules file that helps
    create kernel related packages. The crusty old mechanism has been
     removed, the targets are now streamlined, and the policy mandated
     dependencies are now called out into a separate file. This should allow
     a future enhancement to allow end users to override the behavior of
     kernel-package in a fine grained fashion. Also, separating out the
     variable setting for each arch into a separate file should facilitate
     the delegation of that file to the person responsible for kernel images
     for that architecture. And, separating out the policy mandated targets
     into fine grained double colon targets allows people to add in any
     additional make targets for a particular architecture, something long
     requested.
            One of the factors that made the build mechanism so complex was
     that the rules file had a dual purpose: Initially, when ./debian was not
     present or not populated, it was responsible for populating that, and
     then it was responsible for building the kernel packages, incorporating
     any user customizations.
            Unfortunately, since Make reads all the commands at startup, it
     was difficult to incorporate any customizations, but the modularization
     of the rules file makes it possible to have two top level files, a
     minimal make file whose sole responsibility is to populate ./debian (and
     run clean even when ./debian does not exist), and which uses some of the
     same variable setting make snippets that the final top level Make file
     uses when it resides in ./debian. The task of deciding which top level
     makefile to use has now been relegated to /usr/bin/make-kpkg -- which,
     if there ./debian is empty or not present, first calls the minimal
     Makefile to populate it, and _then_ calls the real ./debian/rules file
     to perform the actual task that it was asked. This little intelligence
     in make-kpkg allows the minimal makefile, and ./debian/rules, to be far
     simpler, and allows them to conform to the standards my other Debian
     packages adhere to.
            The goal of this release was to handle the bugs in the previous
     experimental release, but to create a set of packages indistinguishable
     from the ones created before. Pointedly, non-of the minor lacunae in the
     Debian kernel image postinst scripts have been addressed yet. Also, the
     build process is a little more verbose at the moment than it needs to be.

kernel-package (10.002) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Problem with kernel_version.mk causes build
    fauilure", thanks to Horms                               (Closes: #335993).
  * This is a fairly large reorganization of the directory and file layout
    for the package. Instead of a mostly flat directory structure with a
    giant monolithic rules files, we are moving towards a more organized
    structure, with finer granularity of files, which may in the future
    facilitate third party replacement and overriding of parts of the build
    mechanism. Also, this reorganization may make the overall structure
    easier to see (though it may also result in it being harder to get the
    big picture, but I doubt that).

    This time around, I am trying to keep substantive changes to a minimum,
    so files have just been broken up, moved around, but the package should
    still more or less behave the way that it always did (apart from changing
    the stem).
    * kernel/rules (DEBDIR): Test to see if we have
      ./debian/kernel_version.mk, since all kinds of other people create
      ./debian
   * Makefile (install): Adjust for the reorganization of the files, since
     the source files are no longer in their previous locations. Keep the
     destination mostly the same.
   * kernel/rules: This is the one file that has faced the brunt of the
     changes. Large chunks of it have been moved out into separate chunks
     included in this file. The major addition has been are mechanisms to
     allow the file to be broken up. The parts removed are
      o) dpkg-architecture variable are now moved out to
         ruleset/common/archvars.mk
      o) The variables set in the file have mostly been moved to
         ruleset/local-vars.mk, which shall be further broken up into
         smaller parts
      o) For example, the per arch variable settings have already been moved
         out of  ruleset/local-vars.mk into ruleset/architecture.mk -- and
         shall be further fragmented into files in ruleset/arches/, so that
         it would be easier to delegate ownership to domain experts.
      o) The action/rules part of the file have been broken out to
         ruleset/local.mk -- and shall be broken out into
         ruleset/common/targets.mk (which contain policy mandated targets,
         and their dependencies, and ruleset/actual_rules.mk, where the
         grunt work shall be done. It may make sense to further divide
         ruleset/actual_rules.mk into separate files for images, headers,
         doc, and manual packages. At a later stage, actually installing
         files into ./debian/tmp-<something> shall be separated out from the
         subsequent packaging into separate targets (probably in the same
         file), to allow finer granularity for debugging.

kernel-package (10.001) experimental; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "doesn't install: Internal Error: Could not find image
    (/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.27-xxs1500)", thanks to Martin Michlmayr. Well,
    calling kimage vmlinux.srec was breaking the postinst. However, kimage
    does not seem to be used anywhere except in determining the next
    value, namely, kimagesrc -- so I just added .srec to  kimagesrc, and
    thus eliminated the need for hacking the postinst. So the fix was
    earlier in the build process, and not deferred to the postinst.
                                                          (Closes: #333220).
  * Acknowledge the changes made for initrd stuff in the NMU
    series. Thanks to Sven Luther for the work. I have made some changes,
    for example, instead of hard-coding the list of initrd tools one
    considers in the installation phase, now one can set that list by
    editing /etc/kernel-pkg.conf -- and this replaces the hard coded
    list. Of course, the admin at the target location can still over-ride
    that list by editing /etc/kernel-img.con (note, not the same as
    /etc/kernel-pkg.conf above); this makes things slightly more
    flexible. Also, the list of commands does not have to be the fully
    qualified path, the postinst and preinst use the PATH variable to find
    the commands.
  * kernel-img.conf.5: Document the fact that the ramdisk variable can now
    be a space separated list of init ram disk creation commands, which
    need to also support the --supported-host-version and
    --supported-target-version options, just like mkinitrd does. This is
    the list tried at installation time.
  * kernel-pkg.conf.5: Document the fact that one can provide the default
    values for the list by setting INITRD_CMD, but this list can be
    overridden by the one in kernel-img.conf.5. However, the defaults are
    set to a subset of "mkinitrd mkinitrd.yaird mkinitramfs", the subset
    being decided based on the version of the kernel being built, so one
    should refrain from setting this manually -- unless one knows what one
    is doing.
  * kernel/image.postrm, kernel/image.prerm: Added new variable for the
    initrd dependency, and also modified the variable ramdisk to be a
    space separated list of commands, not just a single command.
  * kernel/image.postinst, kernel/image.preinst: Added new variable for
    the initrd dependency, and also modified the variable ramdisk to be a
    space separated list of commands, not just a single
    command. (find_inird_tool): Added function to determine the list of
    viable initrd creation tools present on the target system, and use it
    to select which tool to use for creating the ram fs.

kernel-package (9.001) unstable; urgency=low

  * The previous solution was only one half of the problem: we had made
    kernel_arch available to the maintainer scripts, but had not exported
    the variable to the hook scripts that the maintainer scripts run. This
    is the second half of that work.
  * Bug fix: "/u/s/k-p/image.postinst: $force_move logic recently broke",
    thanks to Aaron M.; "kernel-package: symlinks in /boot aren't update
    for packages created with make-kpkg", thanks to Itai Seggev.  These
    are the same bug, and indeed, as Aaron analyzed, were cause by a
    misplaced '}'.                                (Closes: #313312, #312917).
  * Thanks to Ubuntu and jbailey, there is now a new variable in
    /etc/kernel-img.conf: ramdisk, which allows the admin to choose a
    different program than /usr/sbin/mkinitrd for initrd generation.
  * Added a few bits and pieces for powerpc64 into the rules file. I am
    not sure I understand why one can't ever cross compile powerpc64
    images, but I am adding this in for the duration. This work reflects
    changes in Ubuntu.

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: Please disable the version mismatch check
    for official kernels", thanks to Jurij Smakov. As all the debian
    kernel images are built from the same source, but with different
    binary image versions (the binary image version is a combination of
    the sub-arch and a variation of the kernel ABI), this check is
    erroneously triggered for them, terminating the build. With the patch
    builds finish fine.  This does so by circumventing a sanity check,
    which has some value for the end user.              (Closes: #312280).

kernel-package (8.103) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bug fix: "make-kpkg: fails to unpatch the source", thanks to martin f
    krafft. This was due to recent idiocy in upstream kernel sources,
    where the kernel now assumes responsibility of ./debian directory
    (despite Debian having used this directory for years). The people in
    charge of this code in upstream kernel were not competent enough to
    implement the deb target  in a fashion that it does not break a
    facility that Debian has used for years.  Well, all the kernel-patch
    packages are affected; since nothing shall unpatch correctly with
    2.6.8.1+ kerel versions. It also makes life a pain for official kernel
    image developers, since their ./debian is a dorectory that is not
    recreated by kernel-package (or the broken upstream code); and at
    least one developer has lost an uncheked in  custom ./debian dir

    It is not as if they needed to claim ./debian, since they do not use
    dpkg, and a fix was discussed in August, but no one has seen fit to
    implement that fix and solve this breakage -- so now kerel-package
    works around this idiocy. This makes this update very urgent.

    The generated .debs also do not pay attention to kernel-img.conf (thus
    creating a surprise for unsuspecting end users), they do not massage
    the build and source symlinks, do not run boot loaders, do not handle
    bootloaders that may use initrd in their config, and probably would
    end up generating a slew of bugs that can't be fixed in Debian.

                                                         (Closes: #270169).
  * Bug fix: "make-kpkg doesn't handle CONFIG_LOCALVERSION", thanks to
    Michal ô ¬ihaô ù. The only implementation for LOCALVERSION I saw (in
    linux-2.6.9-rc3/Makefile), is a broken Makefile
    snippet. kernel-package now tries to implement what the documentation
    and comment say should be done                       (Closes: #273147).
  * Added support for hook directories. Apart from hook variables that the
    local admin may set, there are a set of directories where packages, or
    the local admin, may drop in script files. The directories are
      - /etc/kernel/preinst.d/,
      - /etc/kernel/postinst.d/,
      - /etc/kernel/prerm.d/, and
      - /etc/kernel/postrm.d/.
    If they exists, the kernel-image package shall run a run-parts program
    over the directory, giving the version being installed or removed as
    an argument, in the corresponding phase of installation or
    removal. Since these directories do not exist by default, this should
    have no impact on current installations.

  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: &gt;=2.6.5 make clean removes version.h,
    modules_image fails", thanks to Ralf Neubauer. At this point, the
    automated cleaning of the build tree causes more problems than it
    solves -- at the very least, it violates the principle of least
    surprise. The do_cloean mechanism still exists for people who want to
    have the sources cleaned, but from now on, the default is not to clean
    the sources out.                                     (Closes: #242038).

  * Bug fix: "misspellings", thanks to Matt Kraai         (Closes: #233132).
  * Bug fix: "kernel-package: --append-to-version and modules_image don't
    get along", thanks to Daniel Jacobowitz. Starting with kernel version
    2.6.X, the build process for third party modules has been modified;
    now modules are expected to build in hte kenrel sources dir, and you
    set the SUBDIR arg to point to the source for the module itself. This
    arranges for the kernel makefiles to do all the boilerplate work of
    building/running modpost, dependencies, et cetera. The problem is that
    unless the module passes in the same  EXTRAVERSION=XYZ argument that
    the main kernel build process did,  include/linux/version.h shall be
    regenerated, with a different value  now than when the kernel was
    compiled. The only way to avoid this is to make sure the module passes
    EXTRAVERSION also; the 2.6 kernel makefile is very enthusiastic about
    making sure version.h is up to  date. So, make-kpkg now passes a new
    parameter, KPKG_EXTRAV_ARG, to the module; the value is either empty,
    or a string like "EXTRAVERSION=X.Y.Z". The idea is that you can call
    $(MAKE) $(KPKG_EXTRAV_ARG) ... in the modules package and have the
    same version.h info as the main kernel image does.  (Closes: #233152).

  * Install additional useful documentation files in the kernel-doc
    package.                                             closes: Bug#212848
  * Added more voluble informational messages trying to track down
    Bug#212965. Removed Quotes from around the UTS_RELEASE_VERSION
                                                         closes: Bug#212965
  * Added an option to make-kpkg to allow people to specify the command to
    build an initrd image. This is useful if there are many kernel images
    in the system with different initrd filesystem. Also added an option
    to kernel-img.conf to over ride that variable on a per target basis.
                                                         closes: Bug#212602
  * Ship man pages and html documentation of the kernel in the kerel-doc
    packages. Note that you need to have docbook-utils installed to take
    advantage of this.                                   closes: Bug#210630

kernel-package (8.060) unstable; urgency=low

  * The preinst, prerm, postrm -- were all parsing force_build_link from
    the config file, -- all except the postinst. Fixed. closes: Bug#212313
  * make make-kpkg allow mismatches between the new version and that in
    version.h, since we now have a method that allows us to recover from
    that.

kernel-package (8.059) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added handling of the /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build symbolic link, if
    it is dangling. A link to the corresponding kernel-headers location is
    added if it exists. One can also force not checking for the existence
    of the kernel-headers link.                         closes: Bug#211949
  * In some cases, the symlink creation code created a dangling relative
    link, instead of an absolute, non dangling link, since the test
    relative code only looked at the directory names of the source, rather
    than testing for the actual file we needed to link to.
                                                        closes: Bug#211140
  * We used to silently ignore individual patches and unpatches that were
    not found from the list of user requested patches; only complaining if
    none of the user requested patches were found. Now we stop early
    (before doing any patching at all) if any of the requested patches
    can't be found.                                     closes: Bug#211406

    building modules that would install correctly into a pre-buit
    kernel. Document this, remove faulty instructions from README.modules.

kernel-package (8.051) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a postinst hook for source and header images as well. This allows

    headers are instralled, including changing build symlinks if they
    wish.                                               closes: Bug#207145
  * Remove warnings if not in a kernel directory, but in a kernel-headers
    created directory, and if the only target command is a module related
    one. This is a massively reworked variation of the patch in the
    report, and should have the same functionality.     closes: Bug# 207194

    corresponding ENV variable, KPKG_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_IN_SRC, for people
    who use symlink farms to compile kernels and also want to package
    kernel-source and kernel-headers packages.

  * Since the sample module rules were horribly out of date, and had
    serious shortcomings, and there are a number of modules packages
    extant to provide an example, the sample rules file was removed from
    the apckage. I really do think it was doing more harm than good.

  * Added a new sample postint hook script, that shows how local admins
    can enhance the symlinks policy to better suit their needs. This
    sample script implements the wishlist items requested by multiple
    people. I do not think that these should become the mainstream model;
    since the numbers of kernels linked to, the numbers of streams (2.4,
    2.5, -selinux, etc) depend so much on the local install. Instead, the
    vanilla symlink policy should be the default, as it is now, but now
    people can implement whatever policy they choose.

    toggling the state in delayed configuration using the --config switch

  * Due to dependencies, 'make-kpkg buildpackage' results in the kernel
    being patched, configured, unpatched, cleaned, repatched and
    configured again before building starts.  Adding the -nc options to
    the commandline for dpkg-buildpackage would prevent it from calling
    'debian/rules clean' before it calls 'debian/rules binary'.  To insure
    the package is in a sane state if it was previously built, make
    buildpackage rely on 'clean' (this appears safe for a fresh kernel
    which does not even have the debian directory yet). Most of these

  * Cross-compiling a PowerPC kernel fails after the modules_install step
    because ARCH isn't passed.  There are also some other places where the
    PowerPC logic assumes you're running on the target (not
    cross-compiling). Thanks to "Eric C. Cooper" <ecc@cmu.edu> for the
    patch.                                                   closes: Bug#136080

  * When cross compiling, if System.map is present, and we call

    added this to the preinst check that image packages perform if you
    are installing an initrd image. Adding complexity to the maintainer

    version.h if it doesn't exist, but doesn't touch if exists), so the

    sufficient, and I think it is reasonable not to have debian revisions

    There was a comment in the reprt about this holding up test-cycle-3,
    I can back port this to potato if needed.

kernel-package (7.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a new configuration directive for the target machine, namely,
    realtive_links. Normally, the kernel image postinst shall do a
    relative link if possible, or else it shall make an absolute
    link. With this directive, the postinst shall go to extraordinary
    lengths to make sure that the link is relative. The previous release
    also closed a but, namely: closes: Bug#65116

kernel-package (7.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed implementation of the --config target in make-kpkg, to allow
    operation when there is no .config file present. really closes: Bug#64786
  * Fixed the FILES section in kernel-package(5)/ closes: Bug#65730
  * Try and make relative links when creating links to image files, if
    possible. This used to be the old behaviour, but did not work right
    for people who had the symbolic links created in non standard
    locations. This version should work better for most people.
    closes: Bug#64949, Bug# 65116
  * Added to the information message that make-kpkg provides that the
    --revision option also has no effect ewhen making modules; the values
    that were used when the last kernel_image were made are sued (which is
    what one wants anyway). closes: Bug#65212
  * Updated the README about the gcc/kernel issues (which are now mostly
    solved), made the footnote appear more like one, and stuff.
    closes: Bug#65386
  * Make sure we remove modules.dep when the kernel-image package is
    removed, so that we do not get messages from dpkg saying that
    /lib/modules/<version> was not removed because it was not empty. This
    closes: Bug#66341
  * Added a warning in the make floppy routine of the image postinst to
    warn if the kernel is larger than some hard coded limit. This breakage
    should really be fixed in the kernel. closes: Bug#66596
  * Since it is just a suggestion in the packaging manual, do not force
    all flavours to be downcased. (make-kpkg shall still complain).
  * Added a new arch section for sparc64. closes: Bug#64866

  * Cleaned up the postinst some more; make sure that we always know which
    directory we are in.
  * Use absolute paths for the kernel image files real location, os we can
    manipulate stuff independent of the current working directory. Either
    one of these would fix the problem that Igor Mozetic
    <igor.mozetic@uni-mb.si> has reported.

kernel-package (7.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a space after a question the postinst asks.
  * Added a spacs after --backup=t while copying. This would cause things
    to break otherwise.
  * Added a / in the error message when no_symlinks is on.
  * Fix the README to talk about no_symlinks, and not no_symlink.
    fixes Bug # 63606
  * Added three more directives for kernel-imge.conf, namely,
    do_boot_enable, do_bootfloppy, and do_bootloader. All default to YES.
    closes: Bug#63607
  * Added a check in the makefloppy routine to make sure the image we are
    trying to write exists. This closes: Bug#63558
  * Capture the stderr too when testing the bootloaders. This fixes Bug
    63599
  *  Fixed PPC setup to handle new powermacs. This was a (grave) RC
    bug. This fixes Bug# 63559
  * Added checks and guards to ensue that 63558 would be caught and more

kernel-package (7.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Somehow, kernel-doc-blah was never made to have /usr/doc links; it is
    fixed in this version.
  * Added a new option to kernel package to allow specifying which modules
    one means to compile when doing the modulkes targets - this also
    allows people to use kernel-package to compile modules in non standard
    location, by giving a full path for the module directory.

  * Changed image postinst to allow people to specify they want the image
    moved from /boot into some other location (for example, loadlin users)
    closes: Bug#61832
  * Changed the default version number from 1.00. closes: Bug#62836
  * Can't reproduce .config being deleted (and indeed, there is not code
    in lernel-package that directly deletes that file). I'm closing this
    bug until we get a reproducible problem, or at least more
    details. Until then, just chalk it up to happenstance.
    closes: Bug#61606
  * Make sure we ignore spaces in the value of the HOSTCC and CC env
    variables.
  * Make the source package suggest task-tcltk-dev, rather than tk-dev,
    since the latter is no longer provided by modern packages (apparently
    it was not meant to be a publically used virtual package)
  * Rewrote the preinst to pay attention to the kernel-img.conf. Added a
    variable called clobber_modules that shall have the preinst move
    /lib/modules/version dir out of the way silently. (I strongly suggest
    that this varible not be set unless you know what you are
    doing). closes: Bug#62745
  * Added (courtesey of Peter Moulder) a new option called --config to
    make-kpkg, which allows you to specify what configure target shallb e
    used by make-kpkg. Defaults to oldconfig. This was added so you can
    run your usual config step _after_ the kernel has been patched by
    make-kpkg. closes: Bug#61503
  * Added a new target to make-kpkg, called debian, which essentially
    creates a ,.debian directory and runs the kernel patch process. This
    is so you have an alternative to using --config; you can just call
    make-kpkg debian, make menuconfig, make-kpkg ....

kernel-package (7.02) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a dependency on fileutiles >=4.0, since the package would fail

  * Added a simple check on upppercase chars in the version
    string. closes: Bug#61213
  * Made the dependency in kernel-source packagesbe for libncurses-dev |

  * On user request, do not fail to make symbolic links in / merely
    because the system does not ahve the default bootloader installed --
    people are using alternative boot loaders out there. Instead there is
    a config file that can provide the answer -- oif the config file does

  * Make kernel-packageconfig escape single "'"s in the maintainer
    name. Now irish eyes should be smilin' again ;-). This is a bug fix,
    since it causes make-kpkg to fail for people with apostrophes in their
    names.
  * Add warning if using --revision with an official kernel source (in
    other words if ./debian/official exists). Added this also to the man
    page for make-kpkg; this apparently has been causing confudion.
  * closes: Bug#56506, Bug#56544, Bug#56632

  * Never release a version without a full install test. There were typos

  * Pulled back the support for HOSTCC and CC variables in make-kpkg,
    since it caused all modules to fail. In fact, just setting CC=gcc

kernel-package (6.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a smallish patch. This patch allows kernel-package to detect
    whether it should build a sparc32 or sparc64 kernel on sparc

    closes: Bug#39397
  * Added -uc and -us options to make-kpkg to pass on to
    dpkg-buildpackage (this may be opening a can of worms -- I may have to
    implement a dpkg-buildpackage options option)
  * Added documentation for people who want to minimize the time spent as
    fake root, and who want to see the users name (not root) when they run
    uname -a. Provide a secret exra target for thos folks to use.
  * Removed mention of link manipulation in /usr/src, since kernel-package

kernel-package (6.05) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * This fixes a bug introduced in the previous upload to frozen, in the
    handling of the new extraversion. Most of the changes are bug fixes,
    there is no new code.
  * Tightened the reg exp for determining the extraversion to ignore
    whitespace. Use builtin strip to remove leading and trailing
    space. fixes: BUG#32457
  * If the changelog exists, use it to guess at the debian version (this is
    merely setting the default value). If there is no changelog, the
    default is still 1.00.
  * If the .config file exists, use that to guess the subarch for intel
    platforms.
  * Install debian/rules if it does not exist, regardless of
    stamp-configure or debian/official.  fixes: BUG# 31823.

kernel-package (6.03) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * This update fixes a release critical bug, and only includes bug fixes
    since the previous version in frozen, apart from making the package
    2.2.X ready (mostly EXTRAVERSION support). I strongly feel that this
    should be allowed in frozen, even in deep freeze.
  * Added an option arch_in_name to ask kernel package to embedd the sub
    architecture in the kernel image name (this reverses the default of
    always embedding the arch in the name). Note that only the image
    package _name_ is affected. fixes: BUG#31972
  * The new Power macs report themselves as Power Macintoshes rather than
    PwerMac's. Changed reg expression to allow either. fixes: BUG#32262

  * Made it possible to set the subarch to be different from the one one

  * Added to the module compilation documentation by incorporating part of
    the pcmcia-source documentation. This should hopefully make compiling

    kernel compilations.
  * Documented the fact that Flavours should be all lower case to meet the
    strictures of the Packaging manual. closes: BUG#26843
  * Added default values to prompts in kernel-packageconfig, since the

  * allow clean to work even if .config does not exist. closes: BUG#26265
  * Fix case in the name of the Flavours file. closes: BUG#26434
  * Made the images go into $(IMAGE_DESTDIR), which defaults to
    /boot. This can now be set by loadlin folks in the config file to
    whatever they wish. Also changed the postinst to not freak out when
    the image apparently goes missing.
  * Added the support for different config files depending on architecture
    and sub arch. A set of config files for different archs are shipped in
    /usr/lib/kernel-package/Config/. This is useful for people who compile
    for several architectures.
  * Major cleanup and rewrite for mutiarchitecture support. All arch
    related stuff is catured in a section on top. There is no need to edit
    it into the kernel makeile, we can now determine subarchs ourselves.
  * Also pass along the maintainers email address while compiling the
    modules, not just the name.
  * Make sure that sparcs use the vmlinux file, and gzip it. This
    closes: BUG#26199
  * Cleaned up the modules installation part. Now it conforms more closely
    to the kernel makefile, and indeed, it uses the kernel Makefile for
    the newer kernles where the module install path is modifiable using
    the new INSTALL_MOD_PATH variable.

    closes: BUG#24207
  * Added an preinst script for kernel images so that we do not overwrite
    the modules file gratuitously.
  * Added more documentation about kernel-package, as there were
    complaints that it was not advertized at all.
  * Modified the README.headers file to reflect reality.
  * Added a subarch option to make-kpkg for the alpha people.
    closes: BUG#24147

  * Added rudimentary support for the alpha. Please note that locations of

    people may unpack the sources where they wish.
  * Fixed typo in make-kpkg -help, closes: BUG#23276
  * Documented --flavours argument of make-kpkg, which should bring the
    man page uptodate. closes: BUG#23280
  * Doh! A dangling symlink does not return true on an -e test; a valid

kernel-package (4.01) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * In order to do cross compilation, I was asked to export a variable
    called ARCH which is set to the Debian architecture (dpkg
    --print-architecture). Unfortunately, this breaks for PowerPCs:
    although Debian calls the architecture powerpc, the kernel knows it as
    ppc. Things get very confused. This fix is essential for PowerPC
    compilations.

kernel-package (3.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a recommends to shut up lintian; however, we already depended on
    packages that depended on make, so this is a no op.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun,  8 Mar 1998 15:12:28 -0600

kernel-package (3.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mentioned rootcmd and fakeroot in the README. Mention where one need
    to be root all over too.
  * Added error message from a machine that need the --zimage option to
    the Problems file.
  * Mentioned in the rationale that the kernel image configuration files
    are kept in /boot for further reference.
  * Modified README.headers to indicate why kernel-source did not provide
    the headers required by libc6, but kernel-headers does.
  * Brought the headers README up to date.
  * Make the kernel-image suggest SILO on the sparcs rather than LILO.

    Made a series of changes for sparc architecture machines. Since the
    patches are hand installed, please test this version carefully

  * Added documentation for actions take for SILO
  * Created a special config.sparc for sparc machines
  * Changed the image prerm to look for and deal with silo as well as lilo
    installations
  * Major changes in image.postinst for SILO.
  * Added loader specific variables, and passed them in to the control
    file and to the postinst scripts. Added support for config.sparc. Make
    the unpatch happen before cleaning out the debian directory. Do not
    remove the debian directory after applying the kernel patch. Make
    kernel-doc in the binary-indeo area. Let sparcs also have compressed
    kernels

kernel-package (3.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * There were bugs in 3.60, which are fixed in this release. Since the
    changes since pre-3.60 are so drastic, I am including the changelog
    entry again (as most people shall not see 3.60)
  * Fixed copyright files for all generated packages. This is one lintian
    warning less to worry about
  * This is a major change in the source/header packages. In architectures
    different from i386, `kernel-headers-*' and `kernel-source-*' are
    incompatible. This also has an effect on libc6-dev, which depends on
    kernel-headers-2.0.3x | kernel-source-2.0.3x, which is only true on
    i386 architectures. One possible solution would be to make libc6-dev
    depend on kernel-headers-2.0.32, but that won't work because
    kernel-source provides kernel-headers. In fact, since kernel-headers
    are arch dependent, but kernel-source is arch: all, kernel-source-*
    should not provide kernel-header* at all.

    Once kernel source stops providing kernel-header*, and libc6-dev
    depends on kernel-headers-2.0.32 and links /usr/include/{linux,asm} to
    /usr/src/kernel-headers-2.0.32 (nor /usr/src/linux-2.0.32) things
    would work again in a Multi arch compatible fashion.

    Hence, now kernel-source-* packages compiled with this kernel-package
    shall not provide any sort of kernel-headers. For the sake of
    backwards compatibility, /usr/src/linux-$version symlinks are still
    being provided (as people may upload newer kernels while keeping an
    older libc6-dev around, which depends on /usr/src/linux-2.0.32.

    However, I have been badgered enough about this that I shall remove
    the /usr/src/linux-$version symlinks at some point. This version no
    longer registers stuff in /usr/src/.linux-versions, and is no longer
    as paranoid about /usr/src/linux; but it does not outright remove
    those files either, so as not to cause people with older kernels
    having a problem during removal.As soon as it is deemed permissible,
    we shall get less paranoid about /usr/src/linux-$version as well.

kernel-package (3.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed README to also mention libc6-dev, and to remind people that some
    of the dependencies mentioned may already be present on their
    machines. closes: Bug#18306
  * Fixed the copyright to refer to version 2 of the GPL.

kernel-package (3.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added SUBARCH, which is used to distinguish Amiga, Atari, Macintosh,
    etc. kernels for Debian/m68k, and may well be required for the alpha,
    from what I hear. Unlike the FLAVOURS variable, which affects
    everything it can lay its grubby hands on (kernel image, headers,
    source, doc package versions, and where the modules are looked for
    under /lib/modules), this only affects the naming of the kernel-image
    as the source and doc packages are architecture independent and the
    kernel-headers do not vary from one sub-architecture to the
    next. These changes are courtesy of James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>

kernel-package (3.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mentioned in the copyright file that the GPL and Artistic licences are
    available on the file system.
  * Ensure that the /usr/src/linux and /usr/src/linux-<version> links
    always exist, no matter what. Apparently, upgrading from
    kernel-source-2.0.32_2.0.32-1 to kernel-source-2.0.32_2.0.32-3 does
    not create /usr/src/linux-<version>, which breaks libc6-dev.
  * Toned down the language about LILO, so as not to startle new sparc users

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Feb 1998 21:56:50 -0600

kernel-package (3.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ARCH to make called, this allows for cross compiling kernels
    (added on a request by  James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>)
  * Make kernel-headers arch: any, so we can indeed have different headers
    for different architectures.
  * m68k can now handle vmlinuz, so reverse that behaviour in the rules
    file. AFAIK m68k still uses zImage.
  * Improvements to /usr/doc/kernel-patch/MultiArch.gz, based on
    suggestions by James Troup <J.J.Troup@scm.brad.ac.uk>/
  * Upgraded to standards version 2.4.0.0
  * Fixed old FSF address in copyright file.

  * Fixed rootcmd typos in make-kpkg. fixes: Bug#17618
  * Re-did the Headers README file

  * Fixed a typo where we tried to dd /vmlinuz-2.0.32 rather than the
    correct /boot/vmlinuz-2.0.32 in image.postinst. How come this glaring
    an error has gone unreported until now?

    is more of a thinko/cut and paste error. fixes: Bug#16697,Bug#16702
  * No longer a fatal error if there is no /vmlinuz (or
    equivalent). fixes: Bug#16899
  * Added language to the abort on /usr/src/linux not being a
    link.
  * Documented the fact that if you re-run make-kpkg with a different
    revision number, you have to reconfigure the kernel.

  * Important changes for kernel-source-* and kernel-header-* packages: now
    kernel-source-* packages also provide the exact kernel-header-* (libc6
    need only depend on kernel-header-* now.
  * The kernel-header-* and kernel-source-* packages now also maintain the
    /usr/src/linux-X.YY.ZZ links (in addition to the /usr/src/linux links)

kernel-package (3.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HAM modules to the module we know about, these were introduced
    in 2.1.70.
  * Added configure as a valid target to make-kpkg, so people can
    make sure that edits to configuration files are not stomped over by
    make-kpkg (most people can ignore this)

  * Added documentation of rootcmd to the help message (make-kpkg

kernel-package (3.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore unmounted devices while looking for a root file system. Much
    thanks to Thomas Kocourek <tko@westgac3.dragon.com> for noticing
    this.
  * Added handling for root_cmd in the rules file. This should be set to
    `sudo' or `fakeroot' and is only used in the target buildpackage (it
    calls dpkg-buildpackage -r$root_cmd)
  * Made the rules file notice the env variable ROOT_CMD and over ride the
    site wide default.
  * Added a rootcmd option to make-kpkg and have it set the root_cmd
    variable via ROOT_CMD env variable.
  * Document all the above. closes:Bug#14539
  * Make sure that the copyright file for the kernel-doc package is not
    compressed. closes:Bug#14403,Bug#14405
  * Added internal utility kpkg-vercheck to test the validity of the
    package version.
  * Make the kernel rules file abort immediately if the version number is
    not valid, rather than have the it happen towards the end (after a
    long compile). closes:Bug#14597

    kernels. closes:Bug#14527.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Nov 1997 23:30:48 -0600

kernel-package (3.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added README.headers to the kernel-source package as well, since the
    information _is_ relevant to compiling kernels. Since kernel source
    packages have higher visibility than kernel header packages, this may
    help avoid some FAQs from being asked.
  * Expand on epoch numbers on standard kernel packages. Now the README
    file actually encourages epochs (horrors).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Oct 1997 01:59:19 -0500

kernel-package (3.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed image postinst not to use the obsolete -d option to
    superformat. Removed extra spaces from the exec option, so that it is
    more likely to work. Noticed by Joost Kooij <kooij@mpn.cp.philips.com>
    as BUG#14022
  * Note that the proposed two level versioning scheme fails if standard
    kernels use epochs. Further note that one may introduce epochs even in
    custom kernels. This fixes BUG#14067.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 1997 02:47:22 -0500

kernel-package (3.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle obsolete /System.map and /System.old links left around by older
    kernel-package packages. All the programs that look at the information
    in the map files (including top, ps, and klogd) also will look at
    /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to ensure that that file is
    present, and no longer require the symbolic link.
    Actually, having the symbolic link in / is technically detrimental
    (apart from cluttering up /); many programs, though looking in /boot,
    still allow /System.map to override. If you use LILO to choose between
    multiple kernels, then the /System.map symbolic link only applies to
    one such kernel, for all other choices the symbols loaded will be
    wrong. Not having the symbolic links at all prevents this.
    Therefore, the new image.postinst file shall offer to remove the
    symbolic links in /. This should fix BUG#13359

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 10:44:39 -0500

kernel-package (3.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the proposal for the new multi architecture support. Documented
    the new variable patch_the_kernel and the ENV override.
  * Mentioned new behaviour of depmod and friends Re non .o files in
    /lib/modules in the problems file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Sep 1997 00:02:55 -0500

kernel-package (3.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed handling of modules.dep in the image.postinst. We do not attempt
    to recreate a modules.dep, since the man page admits the file so
    created may be incorrect. We warn the installer that there maybe
    problems loading modules into the kernel until reboot iff the version
    being installed is the same as the version currently running.
  * This fixes BUG#13009.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Sep 1997 15:07:02 -0500

kernel-package (3.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mentioned other kernel source sites in the copyright file. This fixes
    BUG#11951.
  * Install files while preserving the timestamp (use install -p)
  * This could be considered a release candidate, as long as a fixed
    dpkg-dev is also provided at the same time. This has been extensively
    tested on the authors machine, and there have been no bugs reported in
    nearly a month.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Aug 1997 12:10:37 -0500

kernel-package (3.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer create a System.map symlink in /, since that may confuse
    klogd when choosing kernel images using LILO. Since top, ps, and klogd
    look at /boot/System.map-<version>, we just need to make sure that
    file is present. This makes us friendlier to multiple images of the
    same kernel version.
  * No longer redirect output to a file in /tmp for security reasons (we
    use a log file in /var/log instead). This fixes BUG#11765,
    BUG#11766 and BUG#11847
  * Added support for different flavours of the same kernel version for
    people who need them. This is based on the ideas and work of Bill
    Mitchell <mitchell@mozcom.com> and Noel Maddy <ncm@biostat.hfh.edu>.
    This should make us fully compliant to having multiple flavours of the
    same kernel version.
  * Added dependencies to targets in rules. Now things should work as
    expected if one edits a .config file.
  * Fixed destination for the Buildinfo file. This fixes BUG#11884.

kernel-package (3.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * All kernel packages produced now list the version of kernel-package
    used in the file /usr/doc/Buildinfo. This is a bit of a Hack.
  * The image prerm will allow you to remove an running kernel image and
    hose your system. You will be warned. (under protest).
  * Added a variable to choose a no symlink option, which puts the real
    images in /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old, not symlinks (similarly for
    System.map). This makes it potentially less useful, since unless other
    action is taken one would have only two images on the machine at the
    time. This has been added for people who use file systems that do not
    implement symlinks.
  * Added a variable to ask for reverse symlinks, that is, vmlinuz is the
    real file, vmlinuz-2.0.30 is the link. This also restricts the system
    to two image files unless the user save a copy, added for people with
    boot on umsdos (can't see symlinks in dos mode) but who want the links
    to see what the image versions are in Linux. Mutually exclusive with
    the no symlink option. (apart from the symlinks, it is identical to
    the no symlink option). These should fix Bug#11395.
  * Fixed typo in control file for kernel-doc description. This fixes
    Bug#11568.

kernel-package (3.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested with 2.0.30 and 2.1.40.
  * Moved config to /boot, where it arguably should have gone to in the
    first place. The /boot directory contains other information pertinent
    to the kernel, such as the System.map file, and the psdatabase.  The
    information about exactly what was configured into the kernel was
    missing, and it can get quite critical on some machines.  Also, the
    config file may serve as a base for compiling the next kernel. This
    file is not really a configuration file (not when packaged as part of
    the kernel-image package), hence it does not belong in /etc (no amount
    of changing this file will have any affect on system behaviour).

    in modutils-2.1.34 fails when it finds a non-ELF file in modules
    directory. This fixes Bug#9243.

kernel-package (3.27) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add in all the changes sent in by Herbert Xu. The changes are:
    * Changed to source package name back to kernel-source-=V again.
    * Changed the installs to be without -o root -g root since it is no
      longer useful as the chowns are done before the packages are built. It
      also means that if it is used in targets like stamp-configure which may
      be run by anyone it won't not generate an error.
    * Made rules file generate the control file.
    * Fixed some typos in chown commands while generating the header
      packages.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Apr 1997 15:12:19 -0500

kernel-package (3.26) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the default image for ppc architecture zImage. This fixes Bug#8696 .
  * Forgot to mention that the source package for the kernel packages
    (produced by make-kpkg buildpackage, for example) has been changed to
    not contain the kernel version as part of the name (all the deb files
    produced have not changed), so we now get kernel-image-xxx_yy_zz.deb,
    kernel-source-xxx_yy_zz.deb, and kernel-headers-xxx_yy_zz.deb, along
    with kernel-source.tar.gz and kernel-source_yy.diff.gz
  * Added config dependencies for module targets

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Apr 1997 00:53:24 -0500

kernel-package (3.25) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added changes sent in by the kernel packages maintainer.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Apr 1997 00:03:36 -0500

kernel-package (3.24) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a bash 2.0 inconsistency

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 9 Apr 1997 13:33:58 -0500

kernel-package (3.23) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed typos in rules for generating external modules

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 9 Apr 1997 12:41:45 -0500

kernel-package (3.22) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Documented constraints on the debian revision field. This is important
     enough that I am reproducing the text of the admonition here.
     The revision number (the argument supplied after the --revision flag)
     has certain constraints: it may contain only alphanumerics and the
     characters + . (full stop, and plus) and should contain a digit.
     NOTE: No hyphens allowed. (Look at Chapter 5 of the Programmers manual
     for details)

     This is because dpkg imposes an ordering on version numbers, so that
     it can tell whether packages are being up or downgraded and so that
     dselect can tell whether a package it finds available is newer than
     the one installed on the system.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 4 Apr 1997 11:48:42 -0600

kernel-package (3.21) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested source package creation for 2.1.30
  * set umask to copy the kernel source files untainted by package creators
    umask.
  * set umask to copy the kernel header files untainted by package creators
    umask.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 1 Apr 1997 11:04:42 -0600

kernel-package (3.20) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Could not reproduce BUG#8274, neither could the original reporter. I have
    made some changes in the postinst to allow leading whitespace in the
    user responses, and tested it on three different kernel-source
    versions.  I believe this bug is fixed now (I have 3 suitable boot
    floppies as evidence).
  * image postinst no longer aborts when the user gives up on formatting a
    floppy, but now offers a choice to proceed with a preformatted floppy.
  * Fixed spelling errors in kernel image postinst, fixing BUG#8409
  * Offer to user superformat if it exists.
  * Tested boot floppy creation.
  * Tested on 2.0.29, 2.1.29, and 2.1.30
  * Spell check the Problems file, mention setfdprm in there.
  * Mention setfdprm in postinst if fail to format floppy.
  * Fix a typo in code determining which floppy drive to use
  * Allow leading whitespace in responses
  * Added required packages to the README file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Mar 1997 22:53:13 -0600

kernel-package (3.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tested again on 2.1.27 kernel.
  * Added correct Handling for ipv6 modules in rules file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 1 Mar 1997 13:52:15 -0600

kernel-package (3.18) unstable; urgency=high

  * Successfully compiled a 2.1.27 kernel.
  * Made make-kpkg not look for modules directory; that directory is
    removed by a make-kpkg clean.
  * Mentioned that ncurses-dev is required for make menuconfig in the
    README file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Feb 1997 23:36:30 -0600

kernel-package (3.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid @#$%$%@! vi changed Feb to February in the changelog messing up
    gencontrol.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Feb 1997 19:29:02 -0600

kernel-package (3.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Started compiling a list of known problems with compiling kernel images.
    This is now available as /usr/doc/kernel-package/Problems.
  * Moved to standards version 2.1.2.2.
  * Removed extra root checks in the rules file.
  * Added error messages to failed root check in the rules file.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Feb 1997 14:40:41 -0600

kernel-package (3.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed kernel rules file so that one does not depend on the existence of
    modules. This fixes BUG#6898.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jan 1997 22:15:27 -0600

kernel-package (3.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made image.postinst conform to standards version 2.1.2.2.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 09:09:37 -0600

kernel-package (3.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Silly typo in postinst (never code when sleepy).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:56:48 -0600

kernel-package (3.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more injunction to run make-kpkg clean regularly
  * Remove /lib/modules/$version/modules.dep if it exists.  Recreate
    immediately with depmod -a.  This will help reinstall the same kernel
    version more than once.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Jan 1997 00:38:59 -0600

kernel-package (3.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added suggestions for fdutils and LILO for the kernel_image package.
  * Fixed typo in include.postinst.  Fixes BUG#6692.
  * Added warnings about possible (recent?) failure to autodetect floppy
    drives if using old fdformat from miscutils while creating a boot disk.
    This addresses BUG#6037.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Jan 1997 12:03:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * *ALERT*.  Changed how customization variables are handled. All
    variables are given reasonable (IMHO) defaults.  Then the site
    customization file /etc/kernel-pkg.conf is read in, which can
    over-ride the defaults. THEN, the environment/command line variables
    are used to over-ride the values.
  * New env variables: KPKG_MAINTAINER, KPKG_EMAIL, IMAGE_IN_BOOT,
    IMAGE_TYPE
  * new customization variables: kimage, image_in_boot
  * Edited README to give bare bones documentation for user customizable
    vars.
  * Added man page kernel-pkg.conf.5.
  * Normalized existing man pages according to the templates floating
    around on the list.
  * Added copyright statements to the man pages.
  * Documented changes in make-kpkg
  * Added --bzimage option to make-kpkg for completeness.
  * Added a --zimage option to make-kpkg, (with support in the rules file),
    to make a zImage kernel rather than a bzImage kernel (the default).
    Useful for people having problems with bzImage kernels. Suggested by
    Richard G. Roberto <richr@Bear.COM>
 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Tue, 7 Jan 1997 12:44:00 -0600

kernel-package (3.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added documentation to the effect that make-kpkg is part of
    kernel-package in various READMEs.
  * Made the final location of vmlinuz configurable (since one may have
    it under /boot as well as /).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 2 Jan 1997 11:27:06 -0600

kernel-package (3.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a man page for internal script kernel-packageconfig.  This fixes
    BUG#6304.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 1 Jan 1997 22:02:03 -0600

kernel-package (3.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in kernel image postinst script

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Dec 1996 23:40:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow local configuration of the destination of all kernel related
    deb file (the default remains ..).  Now one can set it to directories
    like ../kernel-deb or /boot/archive/deb or whatever by setting the
    variable DEB_DEST in the conf file.
  * Offer user a choice about floppy drive to use. Also make it explicit
    which floppy drive is being used. This fixes BUG#6037.
  * Warn Intel users that they should get bin86 as well, if they intend
    to compile a custom kernel.  This fixes BUG#6144.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Dec 1996 18:09:51 -0600

kernel-package (3.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * The package needs dpkg-gencontrol to do any work whatsoever, so it
    should depend on dpkg-dev, instead of merely recommending it.
    This fixes BUG#6040.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Dec 1996 01:54:01 -0600

kernel-package (3.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dpkg (>= 1.4) to the dependencies, since older versions do
    not understand the new dpkg --build syntax.  This fixes BUG#6041
  * Fixed target modules config in kernel/rules. This fixes BUG#5836
  * Latest default kernel config file

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Nov 1996 15:11:12 -0600

kernel-package (3.03) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * changed priority of kernel-source package to optional
  * changed priority of kernel-image package to optional
  * Recommended dpkg-dev since kernel/rules call binaries from there
    This fixes a problem that a number of people have reported on the
    lists, though it never made it as a formal bug report.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Nov 1996 11:02:31 -0600

kernel-package (3.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * kernel-source-X.XX now no longer recommends bin86, since bin86 is only
    available Intel platforms.  It now merely mentions it in the
    description.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Thu, 7 Nov 1996 22:18:15 -0600

kernel-package (3.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed one last typo in postinst. This (finally) fixes Bug#4234.
  * Also, version 3.00 fixed Bug#4500 and Bug#4624
  * kernel-source-X.XX now recommends bin86, which fixes Bug#4443
  * Added short, succinct (and potentially dangerous) instructions on
    compiling kernels at the top of the README file.  This fixes Bug#4445.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@datasync.com>  Wed, 6 Nov 1996 23:58:35 -0600

kernel-package (3.00) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed the kernel-package to the new packaging schemes.
  * Removed the dist, source, and diff targets for make-kpkg, added
    binary-arch, binary-indep, and buildpackage targets.
  * Changed make-kpkg to reflect reorganization of the
    /usr/lib/kernel-package/ tree.
  * Changed Author email.
  * Removed dithering about ./debian/* in kernel sources, now make-kpkg
    looks only at /usr/lib/kernel-package/ (clears confusion about older
    versions of kernel-package).
  * Modified make-kpkg.8 to reflect changes in make-kpkg, and ran a spell
    check.
  * Renamed debian/package.config to kernel-packageconfig, and removed
    (obsolete) references to dchanges)
  * Moved *.README to copyright.*, and changed the rules files to
    conform.
  * Added explanation for kernel-headers-X.XX (and why we need this
    package in spite of having headers in libc5-dev)

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@datasync.com>  Mon, 4 Nov 1996 16:19:33 -0600

Old Changelog:

kernel-package (2.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in make-kpkg man pages where it insisted that it was
    make-dpkg ;-)
  * Made the close brackets agree with open brackets in the man page
    synopsis.   This fixes Bug#3960

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

kernel-package (2.02) unstable; low

  * Made image.postinst more polite.
  * Also enabled kernel-{source,image,headers} targets in kernel.rules
  * Changed make-kpkg to also accept the new targets.
  * Fixed typo in man page.
  * The man page says it is an administrators man page rather than a
    programmers man page.
  * Recommended libc-dev for kernel-source and kernel-package
  * source suggests ncurses3.0-dev, tk40-dev and the description explains
    you could use make menuconfig rather than plain old make config if you
    had these packages.
  * Fixed typo in the rules for modules in /usr/src/modules/ directory
  * Made the rules for such modules ignore errors (since they are not
    really a part of this package, error there should not halt this build
    (or so people seem to want it)
  * Look for modules in the kernel config file (or the default config file
    if the user has not supplied a config file), and only make modules and
    install them if modules have been configured in the config file. This
    could be tested better.
  * Fixed the make-kpkg.8 man page so that it now does not seem to mandate
    a source and diff file for additional modules installed under the
    directory /usr/src/modules/ (whether these files are produced is at
    the discretion of the maintainer of that modules package.
  * Make configure depend on stamp-configure which in turn depends on
    .config Hopefully, this will remake the image target if one changes
    the config file Hopefully, this will not cause the image target to
    build needlessly.

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>

kernel-package (2.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the scripts to refer to /usr/bin/perl rather than /bin/perl.
  * Added an extended description to the image control file.
  * Added a note that the dist target requires a PGP key.
  * Fixed a typo (missing DEBDIR) in debian.rules.
  * Fixed the targets expected by make-kpkg (kernel_image rather than
    kernel-image, etc).
  * In image.postinst, made arguments to system be a single argument if
    the arguments contain shell meta-characters, (this way perl passes
    them to sh -c).
  * Made make-kpkg accept non floats as revision numbers, to facilitate
    local names.
  * Fixed silly bug in makefloppy in image.postinst.
  * Fixed the extended description of the kernel-package package.
  * Updated the image postinst to install the mbr, if it exists, and to
    activate the root partition, and to not overwrite the mbr (oops).
  * Changed maintainer email address to debian.org (I'll be in a state of
    flux soon)
