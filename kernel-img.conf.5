.SH NAME
kernel\-img.conf \- site wide configuration file for kernel image packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file
.I /etc/kernel\-img.conf
is a simple file looked at by the kernel image post installation
process to allow local options for handling some aspects of the
installation, overriding the defaults built into the image itself.
.PP
The format of the file is a simple
.IB VAR = VALUE
pair. Boolean values may be specified as
.IR Yes ,
.IR True ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR No ,
.IR False ,
.IR 0 ,
and are case insensitive.
This file is automatically created by the installation script in
certain circumstances.
.PP
At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:
.TP
.B postinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed during installation. The
path can be a relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that
is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an
absolute path instead. Before calling this script, the env variable
.B STEM
shall be set to the value of the
.I \-\-stem
argument (or the default value, linux), and
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package.  This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall cause the
postinst to fail. Since debconf is in use before the script is called,
this script should issue no diagnostic messages to stdout -- while the
postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
An example script for grub users is present in
/usr/share/doc/kernel\-package/ directory.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/postinst.d directory.
.TP
.B postrm_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed in the postrm (that is,
after the image has been removed) after all the remove actions have
been performed. The path can be a relative path if the script lives in
a safe path -- that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or
/usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path instead. The environment
variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall produce a
warning message, but shall be otherwise ignored. Since debconf is in
use before the script is called, this script should issue no
diagnostic messages to stdout --  while the postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/postrm.d directory.
.TP
.B preinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package is
unpacked, and can be used to put in additional checks. The path can be
a relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it
lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute
path instead. The environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/preinst.d directory.
.TP
.B prerm_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Set this variable to a script to be executed before the package files
are removed (so any added files may be removed) . The path can be a
relative path if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it
lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute
path instead. The environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the
first being the
.I version
of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
.I location
of the kernel image itself. Errors in the script shall cause the prerm
to fail. Since debconf is in use before the script is called, this
script should issue no diagnostic messages to stdout -- while the
postinst does call
.BR db_stop ,
debconf does not restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/prerm.d directory.
.TP
.B src_postinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a script run during
the post inst of a docs, headers or a source package. Using this hook
for the headers package is now being deprecated, at some point the
headers post install script shall only run the header_postinst_hook.
The path can be a relative path if the script lives in a safe path --
that is, if it lives in /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must
be an absolute path instead. The environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package.  This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I name
of the package being installed (could be kernel source or headers),
and the second argument being the
.I version
of the package being installed. Errors in the script shall cause the
postinst to fail.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/src_postinst.d directory.
.TP
.B header_postinst_hook
.BR DEPRECATED :
Unlike the other hook variables, this is meant for a script run during
the post inst of a headers package only. The path can be a relative
path if the script lives in a safe path -- that is, if it lives in
/bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin, or must be an absolute path
instead. The environment variable
.B KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION
shall be set to the version of the kernel\-package that created the
package. This script shall be called with two arguments, the first
being the
.I name
of the package being installed, and the second argument being the
.I version
of the package being installed. Errors in the script shall cause the
postinst to fail.
This script is run
.I after
the scripts in /etc/kernel/header_postinst.d directory.
.TP
.B clobber_modules
If set, the preinst shall silently try to move /lib/modules/version
out of the way if it is the same version as the image being
installed. Use at your own risk.
This variable is unset by default.
.TP
.B warn_reboot
This variable can be used to turn off the warning given when
installing a kernel image which is the same version as the currently
running version. If the modules list is changed, the modules
dependencies may have been changed, and the modules for the new kernel
may not run correctly on the running kernel if the kernel ABI has
changed in the meanwhile. It is a good idea to reboot, and this is a
note to remind you. If you know what you are doing, you can set this
variable to no. This variable is set by default.
.TP
.B relink_build_link
This option manipulates the build link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link, and if a the corresponding kernel headers
appear to have been installed on the system, a new symlink shall be
created to point to them. The default is to relink the build link
(YES).
.TP
.B force_build_link
This option manipulates the build link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link, a new symlink shall be created to point
to kernel headers data in /usr/src, whether they have been installed or
not. The default is unset, we don't create potentially dangling
symlinks by default.
.TP
.B relink_src_link
This option manipulates the source link created by recent kernels. If
the link is a dangling link it is deleted at install time. The default
is to relink (delete) the source link (YES).
.TP
.B silent_modules
This option has been put in for the people who are vastly irritated on
being warned about preexisting modules directory
.IR /lib/modules/$version .
That directory may belong to an old or defunct kernel image package,
in which case problems may arise with leftover modules in that
directory tree, or the directory may legitimately exist due to a
independent modules package being installed for this kernel version
that has already been unpacked.  In this latter case the existence of
the directory is benign.  If you set this variable, you shall no
longer be given a chance to abort if a preexisting modules directory
.I /lib/modules/$version
is detected.  This is unset by default.
.TP
.B ignore_depmod_err
If set, does not prompt to continue after a depmod problem in the
postinstall script. This facilitates automated installs, though it may
mask a problem with the kernel image. A diagnostic is still
issued. This is unset be default.
.SH FILES
The file described here is
.IR /etc/kernel\-img.conf .
Also, there are example scripts suitable for dropping into
.IR /etc/kernel/*.d
installed in
.IR /usr/share/doc/kernel-common/examples.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR make (1),
.BR make\-kpkg (1),

.SH BUGS
There are no bugs.  Any resemblance thereof is delirium. Really.
